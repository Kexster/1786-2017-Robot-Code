  * Make sure to comment in your files AND document your code on the [team wiki](http://code.dublinschool.org/wiki). If you don't know how to edit the wiki page inquire and you will be taught.
3. Test your code! Preferably in a physical manner, but depending on the situation simulations may be suitable.
4. Make a pull request to this repo
5. We'll go over the code together as a group and merge it in if it's all good.  

If you are a member of Team 1786 and find an issue with the code that should be resolved later, **do** the following:  

1. Make a new issue or comment on an existing issue on the repo's github page under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Team1786/1786-2017-Robot-Code/issues). Try to describe the issue as precisely as possible and indicate any progress you've made on it, if at all. 
2. Eventually try to fix the problem

If you are on Team 1786 and wish to contribute to this project, do **NOT** the following:  
* Make a branch named after the author. You should make branches based on features, not people
* Commit directly to this repo without a pull request. Please.
* Make uncommented code. (I'm currently in the process of commenting previous year's code)
* Make undocumented code.



## Extra Notes
Eventually a makefile will live in this repo that will allow you to build the code without eclipse. It will be commented and include instructions on this readme.
